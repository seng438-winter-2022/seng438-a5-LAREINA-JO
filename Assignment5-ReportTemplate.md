# Introduction

This assignment aims to test our ability to check the reliability of the system using the given failure data. In this assignment, we can practise the use of reliability tools and two reliability tests: reliability growth testing and RDC. 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

# 

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

# 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
